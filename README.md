# DashcamETL
Developed an end-to-end Datawarehouse solution using PostgreSQL, Python (for data cleaning, transformation and data analysis) and Tableau (for data visualization) by analyzing traffic violations across 50 states in the US. The insights obtained were used to provide recommendations to the Dashcam company to increase their sales. The data was taken from data.gov website and the files were segregated based on the problem statement. The data for dimension tables had been uploaded but due to size constraints fact table data could not be uploaded. PostgreSQL queries show the table creation , updation and analysis queries. Reports tableau file shows the visualizations done to answer business questions. The tableau results were used to identify top 5 states with highest number of traffic violations and accidents where a Dashcam company can target their marketing strategies to increase their sales.
